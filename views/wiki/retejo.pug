      h1 Retejo
    div
      p Retejo is a collection of art, writings and projects that I would like to share with the world. My own personal expression platform.
      p The site is currently hosted using node.js and static webpages written in the Pug template language.
    div
      h2 The Plan
      p Eventually to be a lightweight application which will serve webpages that pull information from flat databases. While it's' currently written in Node.JS and Pug the final 1.0 version will simply be a router and a renderer which points to template files that watch for new files and build their content when there is an update.
